ACCEPTABLE FAILURES (MVP REALITY)

These are NOT product failures:

- AI misses 1–2 items in very messy PDFs
- Size not extracted correctly
- Ambiguous UOM flagged for review
- OCR errors in scanned PDFs

These ARE product failures:

- One logical item split into multiple rows
- System guesses quantity or UOM
- User forced to manually rebuild items
- Excel includes non-material text

Rule:
- If review fixes it in < 1 minute → ACCEPTABLE
