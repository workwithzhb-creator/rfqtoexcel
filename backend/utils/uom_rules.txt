UOM Normalization Rules (CHATGPT-LIKE + SAFE)

- AI decides what text represents a UOM (uom_raw)
- System must NOT reject unknown UOMs
- System must NOT force a fixed list

Normalization purpose:
- Output consistency only

Examples of silent normalization:
- pcs, PC, piece → PCS
- nos, no, numbers → NOS
- meter, mtr, m → M
- lm, l.m, length → LM
- kg, kgs → KG

Rules:
- Preserve original meaning
- If UOM meaning is ambiguous (e.g. "L"):
  - Keep original text
  - Mark LOW CONFIDENCE
- Never invent UOM
- Never change quantity based on UOM
