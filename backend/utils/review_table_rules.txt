- Review must NEVER require rebuilding items

General Rules:

- No empty cells allowed
- One AI item = one review row
- System must NEVER split or merge rows at review stage

Editable Fields:

- Size (text edit)
- Quantity (numeric edit)
- UOM (text edit)

Allowed User Actions:

- Correct UOM
- Tick / untick item for export

Disallowed User Actions:
