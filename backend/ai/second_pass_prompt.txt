Review the same document again carefully.

Look specifically for:
- Tables
- Bullet points
- Multi-line descriptions
- Items split across pages
- Items written in notes, remarks, or footers

Extract any additional material, equipment, or construction-related
items that may have been missed earlier.

Rules:
- Do not repeat items already extracted
- Do not clean or normalize values
- Do not invent missing information

Return ONLY additional items in the same JSON format
used previously.
