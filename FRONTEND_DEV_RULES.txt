FRONTEND DEV RULES (STRICT)

- Single page only
- No routing
- No authentication
- No user state persistence
- No local storage history

UI Philosophy:
- Calm
- Clean
- Fast
- Engineer-friendly

DO NOT ADD:
- Sidebars
- Modals
- Popups
- Help screens
- Animations

The UI must feel like:
"Upload → Review → Download"
Nothing more.
